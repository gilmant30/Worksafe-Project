To install onto your local machine first download xampp from online.
Once installed move the entire worksafe folder into xampp then the htdocs folder.
After you must open the xampp control panel and in the "Apache" row click on "config" then PHP(php.ini).
Search for these two lines of code...

;extension=php_oci8.dll      ; Use with Oracle 10gR2 Instant Client
;extension=php_oci8_11g.dll  ; Use with Oracle 11gR2 Instant Client

and remove the front semi-colons which will allow the oracle database access in the apache server.
You should then be able to go to....

http://localhost/worksafe/index.php/competition/index/1

And it will take you to the home page for competition 1.
